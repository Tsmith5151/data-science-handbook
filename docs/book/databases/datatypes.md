# Data Types

### JSON
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
- JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
- JSON is built on two structures:
- A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
- An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

### YAML
- Yet Another Markup Language
- YAML is a digestible data serialization language that is often utilized to create configuration files and works in concurrence with any programming language.
- YAML is a data serialization language designed for human interaction. It’s a strict superset of JSON, another data serialization language. 
- But because it’s a strict superset, it can do everything that JSON can and more.
- One major difference is that newlines and indentation actually mean something in YAML, as opposed to JSON, which uses brackets and braces.
