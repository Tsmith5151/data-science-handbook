### Types of Drift

- **Concept Drift** when the change in P(Y|X) is a shifted in the actual relationship between the model inputs and the output. 
- **Prediction Drift** when the change in P(Y_pred|X) is shifted in the model’s
  predictions. 
- **Label Drift** when the change in P(Y Ground Truth) is shifted in the model’s
  output or label distribution. 
- **Feature Drift** when a change in P(X) is a shifted in the model’s input
  data distribution. 

### Detecting Drift
Data drifts involve a statistical change in the underlying data. Below are
several approaches than can be implemented to automatically detect drift.

###### <span class="label label-success">Detecting Data Drift</span>
- **Data Type Check:** inferred vs observed data types
- **Completeness Check:** completeness of non-null values (%) vs threshold
- **Baseline Drift Check:** deviation from baseline (%) vs threshold
- **Missing Column Check:** observed columns vs baseline columns
- **Extra Column Check:** observed columns vs baseline columns
- **Categorical Values Check:** observed unknown values vs baseline known values
- **Data Quality Checks:** Recurring, Incremental, Outlier, Abrupt Changes, etc.
- **Adaptive Sliding Window:** Works by keeping track of several statistical
  properties of data within a window that  automatically grows and shrinks.

- **Kullback–Leibler**: measures how one probability distribution is different
  from a second, reference probability distribution (e.g. training vs
  production). 
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test** a nonparametric test, meaning doesn’t assume
  any particular underlying distribution. This test compares your data with a
  known distribution and test if they come from the same distribution. 
	- *Null Hypothesis:* Samples are from the same distribution
