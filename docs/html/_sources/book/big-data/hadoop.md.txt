# Hadoop
______

## Ecosystem
- The Hadoop ecosystem include HDFS, Hive, Pig, YARN, MapReduce, Spark, HBase, Oozie, Sqoop, Zookeeper, etc.  
HDFS
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), is one of the largest Apache projects
  and primary storage system of Hadoop.  
- It employs a NameNode and DataNode architecture. 
- It is a distributed file system able to store large files running over the
  cluster of commodity hardware. 

## YARN
- YARN stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator
- It is one of the core components in open source Apache Hadoop suitable for resource management. 
- It is responsible for managing workloads, monitoring, and security controls implementation. 
- It also allocates system resources to the various applications running in a
  Hadoop cluster while assigning which tasks should be  executed by each
  cluster node. 

**YARN has two main components:**
  - Resource Manager
  - Node Manager
  - Pig
  
- A high-level scripting language used to execute queries for larger datasets
  that are used within Hadoop. Pig’s simple SQL-like  scripting language is
  known as Pig Latin and its main objective is to perform the required
  operations and arrange the final output in the desired format.
