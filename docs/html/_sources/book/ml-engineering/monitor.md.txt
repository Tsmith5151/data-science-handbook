# Production Monitoring

### Data Drift
- Drifts involve a statistical change in the data, the best approach to detect
  them is by monitoring  its statistical properties

**Address Model Drift:**

- You could implement a system that periodically trains your models after some
time t, or once it detects a drift  you could refresh a model’s weight by
extending its training with new data. 

**Alerts** 
- Recurring, Incremental, Outlier, Abrupt 
- Adaptive Sliding Window (very common approach)
    - Works by keeping track of several statistical properties of data within a
      window that  automatically grows and shrinks
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**
    - K-S test is nonparametric, meaning doesn’t assume any particular
      underlying distribution 
    - This test compares your data with a known distribution and test if they
      come from the same distribution. 
	- Null Hypothesis
	- Samples are from the same distribution
